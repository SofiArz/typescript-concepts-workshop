# Typescripts review workshop

This project emerged following the course of [Fernando Herreras's React PRO](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-pro/). Besides the key concepts explained there, I'll expand some definitions seen and practice some testing using jest.

If you're starting with typescript like me,  I leave you two resources that I found while browsing that are more detailed:
- [React +TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets)
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide#--usestate)
